    "**Objective:** Learn about how you can point remote datasets to Pegasus by specifying a Replica Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we executed a simple **Hello World** workflow illustrated below, where the input data for the workflow was present in a local directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hello World Workflow](../images/pipeline.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in a real world scenario, the raw input datasets that your workflow requires might be on remote file servers  accessible via multiple storage protocols, such as HTTP, S3, GridFTP, and SCP. You do not need to download these datasets yourself before running a Pegasus workflow. Instead you can specify a remote location in catalog named **Replica Catalog** and Pegasus will dowload the datasets as part of the workflow executed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Replica Catalog acts as a mapping between **logical file names (LFNs)** and their corresponding **physical file locations (PFNs)** across various storage systems.  Logical file names are workflow-specific identifiers used to reference input, intermediate, or output files, while physical file names represent their actual paths or URLs on storage resources, such as local disks, shared filesystems, cloud storage, or remote servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Replica Catalog ensures that Pegasus can find and retrieve the required data efficiently, regardless of where it is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build on the previous notebook and use the Pegasus Workflow API to define a Replica Catalog and specify a remote location for the input file *f.in*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Pegasus will \n",
    "\n",
    "* pick up the inputs from the Pegasus website .\n",
    "* pick up the executables from a directory named **executables** .\n",
    "* place the generated outputs in a directory named **output** .\n"
